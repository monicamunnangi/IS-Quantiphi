# IS-Quantiphi
Quantiphi - Disease Progression from Clinical Notes

• Attempted to predict the onset of Sepsis in patients using historical patient data.
• Precisely used ICU and timestamp data of over 40,000 patients and used baseline logistic regression and
random forests to predict the onset of Sepsis as a baseline.
• Developed a Long Short - Term Memory (LSTM) model using PyTorch which led to F1 score of 0.82.
• Our model could predict the onset of Sepsis 6 hours before its clinical occurrence to assist patients with high
risks of sepsis and give earlier treatments.
Technologies used : Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
